    This is a Flask resource that handles authentication. It receives a POST request with authorization credentials and returns a token if the credentials are valid.
    The token is encoded using JWT and has an expiration time of 60 minutes.
    The resource returns a JSON response with the token if the authentication is successful, and a 401 error if it fails.
    The resource is part of a larger Flask application, as indicated by the import statement at the beginning of the code.
    The JWT_SECRET_KEY is a configuration parameter that should be set in the Flask app configuration.
